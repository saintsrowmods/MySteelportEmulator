# My Steelport emulator

An emulator for the My Steelport service on saintsrow.com that is now sadly
discontinued.

Originally implemented in late March/early April 2015 as a service to run on
saintsrowmods.com. Unfortunately to do auth securely it needs to be able to
authenticate encrypted steam tokens and you can't do this without being
the Steamworks partner who actually built the game.

Nastily hacked up into a standalone app to run on local machines in ~6 hours in
May 2019.
